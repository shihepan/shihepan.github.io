I enjoy taking courses in different fields and discovering connections between them. My favoriate undergraduate course was Quantum Mechanics, and the concept of quantum entanglement was particularly fascinating. My favoriate graduate courses were Deep Learning and Biophotonics, and I am particularly interested in their intersections.

Besides taking courses myself, I am also passionate about sharing interesting knowledges with others. I have worked as a TA and peer tutor for several courses. Here are the courses I served as a TA/tutor for: General Physics I/II, Optics and Modern Physics.
