I enjoy taking courses in different fields and discovering connections between them. My favoriate undergraduate course was **Quantum Mechanics**, in which the concept of quantum entanglement was particularly fascinating. My favoriate graduate courses were **Deep Learning** and **Biophotonics**, and I am particularly interested in their intersections.

Besides taking courses myself, I am also passionate about sharing interesting knowledges with others. I have worked as a **TA** and **peer tutor** for several courses: General Physics I/II, Optics and Modern Physics.

I received [Outstanding Peer Tutor Awards](https://academic-advising.dukekunshan.edu.cn/outstanding-peer-tutor-of-ay-2020-2021/) (AY 2020-2021), which acknowledges and rewards an undergraduate peer tutor who has gone above and beyond in assisting students with their academics.
