Hello! I am a master's student in electrical and computer engineering (ECE) at UCLA, currently working in [Prof. Aydogen Ozcan's Lab](https://research.seas.ucla.edu/ozcan/). Pior to this, I graduated from [Duke Kunshan University (DKU)](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/about/welcome-to-duke-kunshan-university/) and Duke University (a dual-degree program) in May 2023, with majors in applied physics and materials science. At DKU, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiawa Wang](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/xiawa.wang) and [Prof. Kai Huang](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/kai.huang186).  

***I am actively seeking opportunities for a Fall 2025 PhD program, focusing on computational imaging and/or optical computing.*** 

As a prospective PhD student, my current research interests lie in both `computational imaging/optics` and `optical/photonic computing`. I first came across these fields one and half years ago during my graduate school admission interview, when I was still uncertain about which research area to pursue. A year of extensive exploration has now solidified my focus and I am passionate about the future of these two fields. 

In *computational imaging*, I am particularly interested in co-designing novel imaging systems (especially hardwares) with state-of-the-art deep neural networks, targeting applications in biomedical engineering (e.g., OCT, microscopy) and/or computer vision (e.g., unconventional cameras). In *optical computing*, I am currently more familiar with its free-space paradigm (e.g., D2NN) and see its potential for advancing computational imaging. But I am also open to exploring on-chip optical computing to build a real "optical computer", where my background in photonics, materials science, and solid-state physics may be applied effectively.


During my undergraduate studies, I conducted several interdisciplinary projects across a broad range of fields, including nanophotonics, electromagnetism, computer vision, botany, granular materials and robotics. I have always believed that this broad exploration is a valuable foundation for my future research journey. Some of these works have already been published or in the process of publishing. Please refer to [Research](https://shihepan.github.io/research/) for more details.
